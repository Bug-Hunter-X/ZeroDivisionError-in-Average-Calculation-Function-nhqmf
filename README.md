This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can lead to a ZeroDivisionError in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function appears to handle empty lists gracefully, but a scenario where the input list contains only zeros will still result in an error. This demonstrates the importance of robust error handling for edge cases.  The solution shows how to improve the function's error handling to avoid this issue.
